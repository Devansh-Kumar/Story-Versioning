Once upon a time in a forest there live a monkey, who resided on a berry tree which was on the baks of the river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and its wife.
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind-hearted monkey offered the crocodile some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved the fruits.
As day passed by the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
One day the crocodile went to its wife and gave her some fruits that the monkey gave.
The wife of the crocodile loved that fruits too.
She said to the crocodile that if the fruits are too tasty to eat then how will be the monkey's heart, she wanted to eat the monke's heart.
The crocodile said that he cant betray his good friend so he wanted to say no but he couldnt.
One day the crocodile went to the Monkey and told him that his wife has offered him an party at their house.
The monkey accepted the invitation because he trusted his friend but the crocodile couldnt stop himself to tell the truth.
The crocodile told the truth that his wife wants to eat monkey's heart.
The monkey was very smart he told that he left his heart on the berry tree can I have it and come back?
The crocodile didnt knew that so he told the monkey to go and take his heart.
The monnkey hopped to the berry tree as fast as he could and told the crocodile that he shouldnt trusted a crocodile as a friend.
The monkey also told that we cant keep our heart outside our body.
